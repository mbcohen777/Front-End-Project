Site is deployed using surge. 

When a name is queried, a request is made to an api located at www.nationalize.io with the data entered by the user. Empty entries will trigger an alert, and won't be processed further.Results are returned on the page in the form of two-letter coutnry codes in order of probability of being the location associated with the user entry.

There is also a feature for users to enter the two-letter country code and retreive the name of the country indicated. Empty entries will trigger an alert, and won't be processed further.  When the code is queried, a request is made to an api located at www.worldbank.org with the data entered by the user.  Results are returned by an alert pop-up displaying the full name of the country represented by the two-letter country code entered by the user.  

The biggest lesson for me during this project was maintaining the initial functionality of the site while trying to clean up its appearance.  Also, good ideas are good, but only if they are implementable.  A decent, working site is better than an excellent broken one.
